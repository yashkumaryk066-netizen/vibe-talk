# 🚨 CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED
The website is 99% done, but Vercel needs you to press one button because my automated tool was blocked.

## 1. Backend Status: ✅ LIVE
- URL: `https://vibe-talk-backend.onrender.com/admin/login/`
- Check: I just pinged it and it is responding.

## 2. Frontend Status: ⚠️ NEEDS REDEPLOY
- URL: `https://vibe-talk-earn-yashamishra.vercel.app`
- Current State: **404 Not Found** (Because the environment variable change requires a redeploy)

## 👉 HOW TO FIX (Takes 10 Seconds):
1. Go to your open **Vercel** tab.
2. Click on **Deployments** (top menu).
3. Find the latest deployment (it might say "Ready" or "Failed").
4. Click the **three dots** (⋮) or the deployment name and select **Redeploy**.
5. WITHOUT changing anything, just click **Redeploy**.

Once you do this, `https://vibe-talk-earn-yashamishra.vercel.app` will start working instantly.
